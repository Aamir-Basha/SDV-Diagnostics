# Software-Defined Vehicles (SDV) Testing Project

## Overview

This project focuses on developing software solutions for testing engines and vehicles within the framework of software-defined vehicles (SDVs). It involves designing and simulating various vehicle components to evaluate performance, diagnostics, and operational efficiency.

## Features

- Real-time diagnostics and error reporting for vehicle components.
- Simulation of engine behavior under different conditions.
- Battery charging simulation and status tracking.
- Visual dashboard for monitoring engine and diagnostic data.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks:** Express, Socket.io

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Aamir-Basha/SDV-Diagnostics.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies in the server folder:
   ```bash
   cd SDV-Diagnostics/server
   sudo npm install express socket.io
   ```

## Running the Application

- To start the application, run the following command in the server directory:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

- After starting the application, open your web browser and navigate to:
   ```bash
   http://localhost:8888
   ```

## Future Enhancements

This project is in the early stages of development. Planned enhancements include:

- Implementing more complex simulation models for vehicle dynamics and performance.
- Improving error reporting and diagnostics functionality.
- Adding more features to enhance testing capabilities and overall functionality.
